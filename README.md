Project Title:
Horiseon Homepage

Project Description:
Updated website from Html 4 to Html 5 using VSC, cleaned up the code, updated accesibility features, and messed around with the CSS. I attempted to consolidate the CSS but all I seemed to do was break it.

Credit to my tutor Joem for for all the help he gave.
